# Chip-8 Emulator

My take on the famous Chip-8, written in C++.
Based on [this excellent reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM "Chip-8 Technical Reference").
There may be some inconsistencies between this implementation and the reference caused by prioritizing historical accuracy.
